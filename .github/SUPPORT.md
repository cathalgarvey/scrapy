# Getting Support as a Scrapy User

This repository's "Issues" pane is not the place to request support
or advice on using Scrapy. For that, we suggest joining the [Scrapy
community][community] over at:

* The [/r/scrapy subreddit][subreddit]
* The [#scrapy IRC Channel][irc]
* StackOverflow, using the ['scrapy' tag][stackoverflow]
